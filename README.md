# PIC10C-GradeCalculator

This project aims to design and implement a Qt Graphical User Interface that computes the grade of a student given a set of homework and exam scores. In this program, we particually calculate the overall grade of PIC10C.

-Grading
5 homework
1 mid-term
1 final exam
1 final project

There are two grading breakdowns
(15% Assignments) + (25% Midterm 1) + (30% Final Exam) + (35% Final Project) = 105%
(15% Assignments) + (50% Final Exam) + (35% Final Project) = 100%
