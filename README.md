# PIC10C-GradeCalculator

This project aims to design and implement a Qt Graphical User Interface that computes the grade of a student given a set of homework and exam scores. In this program, we particually calculate the overall grade of PIC10C.

-Grading
5 homework
1 mid-term
1 final exam
1 final project

There are two grading breakdowns
(15% Assignments) + (25% Midterm 1) + (30% Final Exam) + (35% Final Project) = 105%
(15% Assignments) + (50% Final Exam) + (35% Final Project) = 100%

# Development Diary

v0.1 First layout of the program (without code)

v1.0 Completed SpinBox and Slider (in sync)
        Stored each hw_scores in an array
        
v1.1 Display the total score of hw

v1.2 Add the Midterm 1 and Final Exam layout to the GUI

v2.0 Complete program following the grade breakdown
(15% Assignments) + (25% Midterm 1) + (30% Final Exam) + (35% Final Project) = 105%

v2.1 Bugs Fixed - Calculation goes wrong and midterm, final exam, final project do not display normally
